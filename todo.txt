 FINAL TODO : 1.Css can be fixed a bit here and there , 2.models can be added for /reserve and /group-dining to store reservations in database when actually being used in real time for restaurants to handle user reservations and handle form submissions 3.Google maps api can be integrated for /reserve which shows the location selected within form in real time in google maps + calendar which shows the dates reservations can be made and which days are full ."
